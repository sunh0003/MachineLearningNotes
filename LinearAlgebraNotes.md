## LinearAlgebraNotes
1. Scalar, Vector, Matrices and Tensor
    * Scalar: single number, lower case, 
    * E.g. let s ϵ R be the slope of the line, let n ϵ N be the number of units. 
    * Vector: **x** lower case with bold
    * Matrices: 2D array **A** upper case with bold
    * In a real-value matrix **A** has a height of m and a width of n, then we say **A** ϵ Rmxn
    * **A**:,i  ith column of **A**, **A** i,:  ith row of **A**
    * Tensors: we need an array with more than two axes. In general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor **A**i,j,k
